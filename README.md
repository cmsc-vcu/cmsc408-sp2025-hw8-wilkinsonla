Homework 8 - World Bank Indicator Analysis

# CMSC408 - Spring 2025 - Homework 7

Welcome to my Homework 8 for CMSC408 (Databases). This assignment focused on exploring and analyzing World Bank data using SQL. The goal was to write a series of SQL queries that investigate country-level data, such as income categories, regional distributions, and missing values across data dimensions. Tasks ranged from simple selects to complex multi-table joins and percent-based aggregations.

## Files

- `report.quarto_ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all SQL queries and results.
- `report.html` – The final exported report rendered from `report.ipynb`.
- `helpers.py` – Python helper functions used to connect to the database and format SQL outputs.
- `/reports/` – Directory containing any output files, logs, or additional assets related to the analysis.

## Required Programs

Make sure the following tools and libraries are installed on your system:

- Python (recommended to use `pyenv` for version management)
- MySQL or MariaDB server running locally or accessible remotely
- Poetry (for managing the Python environment)
- Required Python packages:
  - `mysql-connector-python`
  - `ipython`
  - `jupyter`
  - `nbconvert`
  - `pandas`

## Reflection
This assignment reinforced key SQL skills like grouping, filtering, joining, and using aggregate functions. More complex tasks involved creating pivot-style tables using CASE statements and generating cross-product joins to identify missing data combinations. These skills are widely applicable to real-world data analysis, business intelligence, and backend database work, and they will continue to be useful in future coursework and industry projects.
